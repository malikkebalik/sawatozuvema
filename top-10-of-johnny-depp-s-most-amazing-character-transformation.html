He tries to help others by making ice sculptures and cutting their hedges, but his appearance prevents him from telling Kim how much he cares for her (Winona Ryder).</p><p>Depp was able to portray the guy, doomed to an existence of solitude, with ease. Along with his performance, the incredible makeup work that virtually rendered the actor unrecognizable was praised by both critics and fans.</p><p>Depp was able to truly inhabit the role because of the skin-tight outfits and prosthetics utilized by makeup artists Stan Winston and Ve Neill. The two received an Academy Award nomination for Best Makeup for their efforts.</p><h2>Tonto — The Lone Ranger</h2><p>The Lone Ranger is still one of Johnny Depp’s best cinematic makeovers despite the movie’s poor box office and critical reception and Depp’s practically unrecognizable makeover.</p><p>Depp, a Comanche warrior who aids a Texas ranger in taking down a violent outlaw band, is a mix of Cherokee and Creek Indian descent from his great side. grandmother played Tonto in the movie.</p><p>In the movie, Tonto has dark lines applied in white paint on his face.

His character has mercury poisoning.”</p><p>Depp’s makeup also included white eyeliner and eyelashes.</p><p>According to Atwood, Depp’s costume was loosely modeled on 1860s fashion in order to make it appear more authentic to the era in which Carroll wrote the book.</p><p>Tim Burton, Johnny, and I all conducted some preliminary study into the lives of hat makers in that time period, according to Atwood.</p><p>Unquestionably, the Mad Hatter metamorphosis is still among his best for a film.

He gave himself a platinum haircut and color, and he put colored contact lenses in one eye to emphasize the dark wizard’s threatening appearance.</p><p>In 2018, Depp explained to Entertainment Weekly why he decided to give Grindelwald the unique eye designation, saying it was a “character choice.”</p><p>“If you know what I mean, I saw Grindelwald as more than one. I nearly thought he was two individuals. He is actually two people in one body. A gamey eye, therefore, represents his other side. He’s kind of like an albino twin with a brain for each eye, and he’s in the middle,” he remarked.</p><p>Depp went on to say that the character was “a human version of Finnegans Wake,” the James Joyce book that “begins and finishes in the middle of a sentence,” in Depp’s words.</p><h2>Big Bad Wolf — Into the Woods</h2><p>One of Johnny Depp’s greatest film makeovers may be seen in the movie. In the movie based on the 1986 Broadway musical of the same name, he played a human “Big Bad Wolf” while sporting a hat and zoot suit.</p><p>Little Red Riding Hood is one of many well-known fairy tale characters in Into the Woods.
