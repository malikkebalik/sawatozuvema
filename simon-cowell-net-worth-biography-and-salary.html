His father, Eric Selig Phillip Cowell who lived from 1918 to 1999, was a real estate agent, property developer, and executive in the music business. While on the other hand, his mother, Julie Brett was a ballet dancer and socialite. Despite the fact that his mother was born in Poland and came from a predominantly Jewish family, Cowell’s father avoided talking to his kids about his heritage.</p><p>Along with his brother, Cowell attended Radlett Preparatory School and the independent Dover College but left after completing his GCE O levels. He earned a GCE in Sociology after graduating from Windsor Technical College after passing English Language and Literature.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Asher Angel Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2>Career</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Simon-Cowell.jpg alt="Simon Cowell - career" width=1777 height=1333 sizes="(max-width: 1777px) 100vw, 1777px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Simon Cowell started his career working odd jobs, getting roles in ridiculous horror movies. It wasn’t until his father, an executive at EMI Music Publishing, was able to secure him a position in the mail room that he began to feel more at home. He left to try out other jobs after failing to get a promotion, though, and then came back to EMI.</p><p>Meanwhile, prior to leaving EMI to start his own label, E&S Music, Simon worked his way up the corporate ladder. After that, he began working for Fanfare Records, where he remained for eight years before BMG acquired the parent company. Cowell subsequently established S-Records, his own record label.</p><p>Robson Green and Jerome Flynn, two actors from the UK television drama series Soldier Soldier, were persuaded to sign with him and record the song “Unchained Melody” in 1995 as a result of his persistence. They had previously performed it on the show. The duo’s song, now known as Robson & Jerome, quickly rose to the top of the UK charts and remained there for seven weeks. It became the top-selling single of 1995, and their self-titled album, which was released later that year, also achieved that distinction. Before breaking up, they put out another album, two singles, and sold a combined 7 million albums and 5 million singles. They reportedly earned him his first million, according to Cowell. He later signed acts like Westlife and Five.</p><p>Simon Cowell net worth is an enormous one, he is one of the <a href=#>richest people in the United Kingdom.</a></p><h3>The Birth Of Syco</h3><p>In 2005, Cowell founded Syco, a new business.

Reid, who had announced they would not be returning, with Paulina Rubio and Kelly Rowland. It was Cowell’s second season as the winning mentor after he triumphed with Melanie Amaro in 2011. Cowell’s final act, Alex & Sierra, won the season.</p><p>Cowell extended his three-year contracts with ITV for both Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor in October 2010, keeping them in effect until 2013.
