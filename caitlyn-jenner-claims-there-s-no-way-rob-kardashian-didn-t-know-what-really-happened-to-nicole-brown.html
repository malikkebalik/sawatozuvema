Get Me Out Of Here!</p><p class="dh fh">Caitlyn Jenner opened up about the day OJ Simpson was acquitted and how her family reacted to the news. She also reveals Robert Kardashian knew about the real events that transpired the night Nicole Simpson was murdered.</p><p class=dh>OJ Simpson’s acquittal came as a shock to the world after watching what was deemed as the trial of the century unfold. Simpson was accused of murdering his wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman and in spite of public opinion suggesting he was guilty, he was found otherwise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/84a912c0bb0e72ba766eedb5db97378715827281575962085.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>OJ Simpson after the closing arguments of his trial for armed robbery in October 2008. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>OJ had his lawyers to thank which included Robert Kardashian, Kris Jenner’s former husband and the father of her three daughters, Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe Kardashian and son, Rob Kardashian. At the time, she was already married to Bruce aka Caitlyn Jenner for three years.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Caitlyn believed OJ’s trial was "a joke" but it also had a great impact on her family. She recalled Kris having doubts after OJ was acquitted..</strong></h3><p class=dh>Caitlyn recently opened up about that controversial period where she found herself <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/oj-simpson-trial-caitlyn-jenner-nicole-brown-murder-robert-kardashian-kris-jenner-im-a-celebrity-1333231>in the middle of it all.</a> She also revealed Robert knew more than what others may think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/67dc1f9b2a746e9f88073ad7aa23c03d11927431575962246.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Caitlyn Jenner attending the 2016 "MAKERS Conference." | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>ON HER CLOSENESS TO OJ, ROBERT, AND NICOLE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Speaking to Kate Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa in the latest episode of “I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here,” Caitlyn detailed how close she was to <a class="me a" href=#>OJ </a>and his wife. In fact, she discloses that she was with Nicole just a couple of days before she was murdered.</p><p class=dh>She explains that their closeness was due to the fact that Nicole was <a class="me a" href=#>Kris</a>’ best friend and OJ was Robert’s best man during his wedding to Kris. Caitlyn married Kris just a month after her divorce with Robert was finalized.</p><p class=dh>While Caitlyn became friends with Robert during her marriage to Kris, she couldn’t say the same about OJ. In fact, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC6HHt0g_u0">admits</a> OJ had “too big an ego” judging from their frequent vacations together. It made her think Nicole didn’t deserve her fate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a925602dda5c672e6e02b2c568b0af679537051575962330.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kris Jenner and Caitlyn, formerly Bruce Jenner attending a wine and food festival in September 2010. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>HER FAMILY'S REACTION TO OJ'S ACQUITTAL</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Caitlyn <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC6HHt0g_u0">believed</a> OJ’s trial was "a joke" but it also had a great impact on her family.

"I mean, there's just no way he didn't know,” she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC6HHt0g_u0">tells</a> Kate and Jacqueline.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>SPILLING ABOUT HER DAUGHTER KYLIE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Since her divorce from Kris, <a class="me a" href=#>Caitlyn</a> hasn’t been privy to a lot of things going on in the Kardashian fold. However, there are a few things she’s aware of, such as the extent her daughter, <a class="me a" href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> goes to keep herself safe.</p><p class=dh>The former decathlete recently revealed in another episode of “I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here” that her daughter would spend up to $400k a month for security. She spilled this information while claiming the Kardashian-Jenners have been so used to having security around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c377b071745f2482b66fb9e35c08eb7d9646841575962722.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kylie Jenner at the Harper's BAZAAR Celebrates "ICONS" event in September 2016. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>It’s not surprising considering Kim’s traumatizing robbery experience in Paris and Kylie’s recent problems with a stalker getting into her property. The price for her safety may be steep, but not steep enough for a 22-year-old billionaire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvbmhlbXqkrcito7KmXZ%2Byr7rEq2SsmamoerW0xKucrGWepHq4rdhmo5qslWK%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joanna-angel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joanna Angel">&larr;
