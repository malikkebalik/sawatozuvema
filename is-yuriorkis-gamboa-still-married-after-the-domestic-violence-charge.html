We all know the legend <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong> but it might hurt you to know the next generation of this sport filled with sweat and blood.</p><p><strong>Yuriorkis Gamboa </strong>is a Cuban boxer who has participated in three weight classes: Lightweight, Featherweight, and Superfeather weight. He is a former unified featherweight world champion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Private_Life></span>His Private Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yuriorkis’s private life is often under the shadows. The boxer sure likes to keep his marital information secretive. The man is married, that’s for sure but even his wife’s picture is hard to find on media.</p><p>Gamboa is married to a girl named <strong>Dunia Francisco</strong>. There are no details about his relationship with the girl before their marriage. The pair got married probably before 2010. But it is of no doubt that the champion had a problematic marital life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Yuriorkis-Gamboa-hook.jpg><p>The boxing champ got arrested in May of 2011 for the charges of domestic violence. According to sources, Gamboa’s wife called the police at 3:14 in the morning to report against the violence.</p><p><strong>Also, See: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fedor Emelianenko Married Thrice (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Fedor Emelianenko Married Thrice</a></strong></p><p>As it happens, the girl tried to leave the house with their son as Gamboa was alleged of cheating with another girl. As for the reaction, Gamboa tried to stop her and grabbed the back of her neck and arm in the process.</p><p>The boxer later stated that he didn’t want Dunia to take his son away from him. Furthermore, his lawyer stated on his interview with “boxingscene” that there were not any kind of hits or excessive violence.</p><p>The thing eventually settled down with settlement factors unknown to this day. But it seems, the boxer had not reconciled with his wife. The Cuban champ hit the news again in 2013. So, what did he do this time?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Yuriorka-and-Davis.jpg><p>Well, the champ yet again got arrested for domestic violence. The arrest was done on the 14th of November with no-contact order with his wife and other females.</p><p>Luckily, the boxer did not get involved in any sort of serious charges that affected his career in the long run. There are no reliable sources, but the man probably moved on from his problems and focused on his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Yuriorkis%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth_as_of_2019></span>What is Yuriorkis’s Net Worth as of 2019?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Cuban boxer has an estimated net worth of <strong>$2</strong> <strong>million</strong>. The major source of his income traces back to his career as a professional boxer and athlete.</p><p>Yuriorkis has been a champion from his early career. He won an Olympic gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympic held at Athens. He participated in the flyweight class division.</p><p><strong>Also, Discover: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Everything about Snoh Aalegra’ Personal and Professional Life! (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Everything about Snoh Aalegra’ Personal and Professional Life!</a></strong></p><p>Not only that, he had grabbed another gold medal at the 2003 Santo Domingo Pan American Games and a couple of bronze medals in 2005 and 2006 in World Amateur Championships and Central American and Caribbean Games. The athlete had also won a silver medal in Moscow at the 2005 World Cup.</p><p>The 38-year-old boxer debuted professionally in April of 2007 and defeated Alexan Manvelyan in the match. This victory followed with a rain of titles including the vacant NABF Super Featherweight title, WBC International Super Featherweight title, and WBO NABO Featherweight honor in 2008.</p><p>The boxer’s reign continued in 2009 with his victory over Jose Rojas for the WBA Featherweight title. He went on to grab the titles of the vacant IBF Featherweight Championship in 2010, the Interim WBA Super Featherweight title in December of 2012 and also the Interim WBA Lightweight title in June of 2013.</p><p>Gamboa tasted defeat in 2014 in his match against Terence Crawford. The match was for the title of the WBO Lightweight title. However, he won his last match against Joel Montes de Oca in November of 2011 and brought his professional record to an impressive 24-1.</p><p><strong>You Might Like This: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Alex Honnold Married Fellow Climber; Who is She?

This time, he got knocked down by <strong>Gervonta Davis</strong>. The match went on for twelve rounds with Davis emerging as the victor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The boxer later mentioned that he had played the match with a ruptured Achilles tendon. The injury got him in the second round. Despite the defeat, the boxer is quite positive towards the future and hopes to recover from his injuries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_Yuriorkis_Gamboa></span>Quick Facts: Yuriorkis Gamboa<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Gamboa had made his United States debut on the 30th of October, 2007 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel.</li><li>He has an Orthodox boxing stance.</li><li>The boxer is also known by his nickname of The Cyclone from Guantanamo.</li><li>He had once sold his Olympic gold medal to support his family.</li><li>During his career, he had once signed a contract with Money Team Productions of <strong>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</strong> but the deal fell through.</li></ul><p>For more celebrity-related content, visit <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="TheCelebsCloset (opens in a new tab)">TheCelebsCloset</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaLGlp7awvsqiqmafkaKvsK2MppirqpmasW64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mariah-carey-shares-rare-makeup-free-selfie-photo-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mariah Carey Shares Rare, Makeup-Free Selfie: Photo  Hollywood Life">&larr;
