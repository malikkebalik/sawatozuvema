He is best known as the owner of the NFL team, the Indianapolis Colts. With a Hungarian and Polish descent, he has made significant contributions to the league, including initiating rule changes over the years, resulting in a remarkable increase in his net worth.</p><p>The Mid-2016 estimates indicated a net worth of $2.3 billion, largely attributed to his family’s wealth and his strategic investments. He was born into a family already experienced in business and wealth, and his fortune is expected to continue growing in the upcoming years.</p><h3>Jim Irsay’s Net Worth: $2.3 Billion</h3><p>Jim pursued his education at Loyola Academy and later attended Southern Methodist University, majoring in broadcast journalism. He was also part of the university’s football team but had to end his playing career due to an injury. In 1982, he graduated and embarked on a journey in the NFL, working for the Baltimore Colts team, which was owned by his father, Robert Irsay.</p><p>After spending two years with the Colts, he assumed the position of General Manager and Vice-President, coinciding with the team’s move to Indianapolis. In 1995, Irsay further advanced to Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer while retaining his dual role as General Manager. Following his father’s passing in 1997, Jim made history by becoming the youngest NFL team owner at the age of 37, winning the ownership rights over his stepmother. Under Jim’s leadership, the Colts flourished, making notable acquisitions such as Andrew Luck and Peyton Manning. He also facilitated significant trades, including the acquisition of Eric Dickerson in 1987. Jim was also instrumental in implementing rule changes and imposing appropriate fines for rough plays. Not only did he oversee most of the team’s external activities, but he also emphasized the importance of maintaining the NFL’s image, expressing disapproval towards other owners using inappropriate language.</p><p>Beyond his involvement in football, Jim has diversified his investments, particularly in the music industry. His portfolio includes collectible guitars from Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon, along with a drum set once owned by Ringo Starr. Irsay has also ventured into the ventilation, air conditioning, and heating sectors, substantially augmenting his net worth while continuing to manage the football team.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jim was married to Meg Coyle from 1980 to 2013, and they have three daughters. The couple had been separated for ten years before their divorce. Moreover, Jim struggled with a drug addiction, necessitating a break from the team, during which one of his daughters assumed management responsibilities. Reports also surfaced about his arrest for DUI and suspicion of drug possession, as well as the tragic death of his mistress due to a drug overdose. Apart from these personal challenges, Jim has been active in politics, supporting figures such as Harry Reid and John Edwards.</p><h3>Structural Info</h3><p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jim Irsay</p><p><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $2.3 Billion</p><p><strong>Date Of Birth:</strong> June 13, 1959</p><p><strong>Place Of Birth:</strong> Lincolnwood, Illinois, United States</p><p><strong>Profession:</strong> Owner, CEO of the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Southern Methodist University, Loyola Academy</p><p><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</p><p><strong>Spouse:</strong> Meg Coyle (m. 1980–2014)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Carlie Irsay, Kalen Irsay, Casey Irsay</p><p><strong>Parents:</strong> Harriet Pogorzelski, Robert Irsay</p><p><strong>Siblings:</strong> Robert Irsay, Roberta Irsay</p><p><strong>Twitter:</strong><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/JimIrsay</a></p><p><strong>IMDB:</strong> <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0410107</a></p><h3>Facts</h3><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><td>#</td><td>Fact</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Inducted into the Central Indiana Business Hall of Fame in 2012.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>General manager of the Indianapolis Colts, 1984-1994.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Owner of the Indianapolis Colts, 1997-present.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Filmography</h3><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihoqVdnr%2B0rdisZLCdkaHBqXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./josh-gordon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Gordon">&larr;
