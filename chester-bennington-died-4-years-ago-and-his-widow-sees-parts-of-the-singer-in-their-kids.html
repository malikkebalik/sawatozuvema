At the time, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/chesterbe/status/1674081458?lang=en">wrote</a>, "I have the cutest kids ever."</p><p class=dh>During one of his daughter's graduation back then, he deemed the occasion "one of the greatest moments" of his life and frequently tweeted about his family on the platform.</p><p class=dh>Chester's first child was Jaime, born in 1996, whom he shared with his former girlfriend, Elka Brand. His second child, Draven, was born in 2002 to his first wife, Samantha Marie Oil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/79a2ad88dc7cfc085c765dfae98dee8a.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Fans comfort Talinda Bennington on the 4th anniversary of her husband's death | Source: Instagram/@talinda320</p><p class=dh>After the pair divorced in 2005, he married Talinda, and their first child together, Tyler, was born the following year. In 2006, Chester formally adopted Brand's other son, Jaime's half-brother Isaiah, and welcomed him into the family.</p><p class=dh>In 2011, he and Talinda welcomed their second and third children, twin girls Lila and Lily. In addition to his five biological children and one adopted son, Chester was also the godfather to another boy who is the child of his friend Chris Cornell.</p><p class=dh>Chester committed suicide on July 20, 2017, and was 41 years old. The Arizona native had previously openly talked about the struggles he faced and about having suicidal thoughts.</p><p class=dh>Through his lyrics, his dark side became evident. After giving an interview just months before his death about trying to put his troubled past behind him and overcome depression, Chester ultimately took his own life on his dear friend Cornell’s birthday – shortly after Cornell committed suicide.</p><p class=dh>Following his passing, Talinda spoke out and said her late husband is now "pain-free" after committing suicide while questioning how she was supposed to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/chester-bennington-widow-breaks-silence-singer-suicide-article-1.3365230>move</a> on after his death:</p><p class=dh>“I lost my soulmate, and my children lost their hero – their Daddy. We had a fairytale life, and now it has turned into some sick Shakespearean tragedy."</p><p class=dh>“How do I move on?” she continued. “How do I pick up my shattered soul? The only answer is to raise our babies with every ounce of love I have left.”</p><p class=dh>Talinda described Chester as a bright, loving soul with an angel's voice. "And now he is pain-free, singing his songs in all of our hearts," she said in a statement.</p><p class=dh>The former couple got married in 2006 and had three children together. Chester was found unresponsive in his Palos Verdes Estates home in Los Angeles.</p><p class=dh>The mother of his kids was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on September 18, 1976. <a class="me a" href=#>Talinda</a> worked several odd jobs when she was a teenager, including being a schoolteacher, a waitress, and a trainer.</p><p class=dh>During her time as a teacher, she taught science to 6th grade to 8th-grade students.
