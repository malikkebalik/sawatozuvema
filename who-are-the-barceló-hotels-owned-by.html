This marked the beginning of the second generation ownership of the Barceló Hotels.</p><h3>Led by Simón Barceló’s sons Miguel and Gabriel in the 1970s-80s</h3><p>Miguel and Gabriel Barceló took over the reins of the company and continued to build upon their father’s legacy. They brought fresh ideas and innovation to the table, ensuring that the Barceló brand remained at the forefront of the hospitality industry.</p><h3>Purchased existing hotels and built new resort properties</h3><p>Under the leadership of Miguel and Gabriel, Barceló Hotels expanded its portfolio by acquiring existing hotels and also constructing new resort properties. This strategic move allowed them to cater to a wider range of customers and increase their presence in popular tourist destinations.</p><p>The brothers carefully selected prime locations for their new resorts, ensuring that guests could enjoy stunning views, luxurious amenities, and an unforgettable vacation experience.</p><h3>Extended the Barceló brand into other Spanish vacation destinations</h3><p>In addition to expanding their presence in existing locations, the Barceló brothers extended the Barceló brand into other Spanish vacation destinations. This move allowed them to tap into new markets and attract a diverse clientele.</p><p>By leveraging their expertise and reputation, Miguel and Gabriel successfully established Barceló Hotels as a leading name in the hospitality industry, not only in their original locations but also in new and exciting destinations.</p><p>Today, Barceló Hotels continues to thrive under the leadership of the Barceló family, with Miguel and Gabriel’s children actively involved in the business. Their commitment to excellence and innovation has ensured that the Barceló brand remains synonymous with exceptional hospitality and unforgettable experiences.</p><h2>Third Generation and Beyond</h2><p>Barceló Hotels, a renowned hospitality brand, is currently managed by Simón Barceló Tous, who belongs to the third generation of the Barceló family.

This beautiful city, located in the Balearic Islands, serves as the central hub for the brand’s operations.</p><p>The headquarters in Palma de Mallorca reflects the Barceló family’s deep connection to their roots and their commitment to maintaining their Spanish heritage.</p><h3>Expanded globally through acquisitions and joint ventures</h3><p>Over the years, Barceló Hotels has expanded its reach globally through strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.
