He was a French-African Muslim.</p><p>He worked as a delivery driver and lived in the Nanterre neighbourhood, in the western suburbs of Paris.</p><h4><strong>Tragic circumstances: The fate of teenager Nael M</strong></h4><p>Nael M, a 17-year-old French-Algerian, was living in the Nanterre neighbourhood, located in the western suburbs of Paris, working as a delivery driver. His life took a tragic turn when he was pulled over in his Mercedes rental in Nanterre for allegedly breaking several road rules.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>There's some sort of an urban war going on in France after the French police shot dead a 17-year-old teenager named Naël M for allegedly not stopping his car. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">pic.twitter.com/8vbu5iycVq</a></p><p>— Hassan Mafi ‏ (@thatdayin1992) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer sponsored">June 29, 2023</a></p><p>The police report states that Nael M failed to comply with an officer’s commands, which led to a fatal escalation. It was during this confrontation that Nael was shot as he attempted to drive away. A video circulating on social media, authenticated by the French news agency AFP, shows the harrowing final moments. It depicts two police officers attempting to stop Nael’s vehicle, with one officer firing at close range when Nael seemingly ignored him and continued driving.</p><p>Nael M’s death at the hands of the police officer, who has since been detained on suspicion of manslaughter, resulted in widespread outrage and rioting. The riots led to 31 arrests, with 25 police officers injured and 40 cars burned down.</p><h4>High level outrage and calls for justice for Nael M</h4><p>His mother, requesting anonymity, expressed her anguish, saying, “I lost a 17-year-old, I was alone with him, and they took my baby away from me.” She added, “He was still a child, he needed his mother.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The tragic incident has also attracted the attention and condemnation of top French officials and personalities. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin declared the incident and video as “extremely shocking” urging “for calm and truth”.</p><p>French footballer, Kylian Mpabbe, tweeted his dismay at Nael M incident: “I hurt for my France. Unacceptable situation. All my thoughts go to the family and loved ones of Nael, this little angel gone much too soon.”</p><h4>French President adds to the incident</h4><p>President Emmanuel Macron added his voice to the chorus of those demanding justice, stating that the shooting was “inexplicable” and “unforgivable”.</p><p>As the investigations into the shooting of Nael M continue, his death has not only inflamed Paris but also sparked a heated debate about police conduct in France. Amid the shock and grief, the quest for justice for Nael M gains momentum, reflecting a broader global struggle against police violence.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>ALSO READ: Moriah Mills releases YDC song for Zion Williamson, lyrics go viral</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ec2anKVlnWLAqbvTZpuemZRir7p5xaucp5uYYr2wuMicnGahnmK9or7IrGSfrZyheq%2BtzJ5km6GfYq6osYynmK2hn6OurbXTsmSrnZyetKq7zWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gma-host-lara-spencer-enjoys-dinner-with-daughter-katherine-before-dropping-her-off-at-college.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'GMA' host Lara Spencer enjoys dinner with daughter Katherine before dropping her off at college">&larr;
