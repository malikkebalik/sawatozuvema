I weighed 600 pounds. When they told me that, I knew I had to focus more on my health. I went from 600 pounds to 400 pounds.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Willie’s story impressed host,&nbsp;<strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong>, who asked him how he was able to get himself into better shape. “My eating was a big part of it,” Willie admitted. “I have a trainer now. I’m doing better. I have no fluid.” Altogether, Willie lost over 180 pounds by the time he auditioned. “I’m just being healthy and focusing,” he said. “If I don’t have good health, I won’t be able to sing.”</p><h2>4.

They’ve been there since the very beginning.” During showstopper week, Willie added, “This year has been a tough year. Being in the hospital really scared me. I thought I wasn’t going to survive. My family got me through it, as well, and I’m very thankful.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Willie’s family even made a virtual appearance during the episode. “We all love you with all of our hearts,” his mom,&nbsp;<strong>Sharon</strong>, gushed. “We pray that you continue and let God let you climb this ladder of success with American Idol.”</p><h2>5.
