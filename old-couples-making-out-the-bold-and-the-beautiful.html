But when you see Brooke & Ridge sucking faces, it’s pretty gross. I don’t think it matters that they’re older. I think it’s more the fact that most people are sick of these two and personally, I don’t see any chemistry between the two actors so it’s just really forced.</p><p>Thankfully, I choose to not watch any clips that have anything to do with Brooke & Ridge.

Bridge make makes my brain hurt. No chemistry and boy do they try hard. Bell has someone reading these boards. Notice how Brooke is not riding back. Just Bell trying to pass her off as changed. She is not flipping out about Liam saying he loves Steffy. She keeps her panties on at the office. It still will not work. Ridge and Brooke are boring. This is why the appear to be old. Ridge did not look old with Taylor. If truth to be told Brooke looks and acts way younger with Deacon. For some reason , I almost enjoy their pairing even tho I hate both. So it is not age, it’s either they are boring, or we have been subjected to it long enough already. Nothing to look forward to. We know the wedding will go through, have to have tsftv win . Wedding and then what, they have tried it all keyholes. What’s next pickle ball? Just disgust me, and they are way to selfish together. Trying to make Brooke look the the family matriarch is never going to work now too much water under the bridge. They had a real chance about 5 , years ago and chose not to. Too late, we know the real Brook is not this character…</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Me too your never too old for romance.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Jen</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>August 18, 2023, 11:02pm <span itemprop=position>19</span></span><p>I agree. Seeing old couples being affectionate is adorable but I certainly don’t want to see them making out. Ridge and Brooke are annoying and seeing them do it makes me shudder. Brooke’s stupid little girl act and giggling. Ridge trying to tease her. Just gross. Can they stop forcing us to watch them? Maybe they can go out of town for a few months and revamp their image</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvOpZtmm5%2Bqva2x0makmqOZo7Ruu9StZnFpZGh9dA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./see-video-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Video  Hollywood Life">&larr;
