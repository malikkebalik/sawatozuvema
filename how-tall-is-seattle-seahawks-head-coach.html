In addition to his role as the team’s official Vice President, he also serves as head coach for the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks. He had previously supervised the NFL’s New York Jets and New England Patriots, as well as the NCAA’s USC Trojans football team, before taking charge of the Seahawks.</p><h2 id=what-is-pete-carroll-height class=rb-heading-index-0>What is Pete Carroll Height?</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Pete Carroll has a height of 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 79.4 kg.</strong> His hair and eyes are a matching shade of silvery grey.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You can also read about how tall are BTS members:</strong></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li><a href=# rel=noopener>What Is The Height Of Each Member Of BTS In Feet?</a></li></ul><h2 id=profession-of-pete-carroll class=rb-heading-index-1>Profession of Pete Carroll</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Beginning his career with the Pacific Tigers football team and later the Arkansas Razorbacks, he was an alumni partner for both teams. After working his way up, he became the head coach of the New York Jets in 1994 and then moved on to the San Francisco 49ers as the protected organizer the following year. He spent the next two years as the head trainer for the New England Patriots before leaving in 1999. In 2001, Pete Carroll was named USC’s head coach, a position he held until 2009. Currently, he is playing for the Seattle Seahawks.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Pete Carroll, who was honored as 2003’s Home Depot Coach of the Year, led his team to the Super Bowl in 2013 and the NFC title in both 2013 and 2014.

His 2014 season was fantastic, culminating in a Super Bowl victory and an NFC championship. A second NFC championship was his in 2014. Multiple times over his career, he has won the National Championship, the Rose Bowl, and the Pac-10.</p><h2 id=pete-carroll-net-worth class=rb-heading-index-2>Pete Carroll Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>You won’t locate such a great number of mentors in the same class as Pete Carroll in the games passing by his varied successes. Pete’s current wealth is estimated to be $20 million. The Seattle Seahawks signed him to a contract in 2016 that would see him through 2019. He is rumored to earn up to $8 million each year, while the specifics of his contract remain unknown.</p><h2 id=who-is-pete-carroll-wife class=rb-heading-index-3>Who is Pete Carroll Wife?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In the past, Pete Carroll has tied the knot twice. In 1973, he wed Wendy Pearl for the first time. Their marriage ended in 1975, therefore they didn’t have a happy ever after. His second marriage, to Glena Goranson, came less than a year after the dissolution of his first. It was when he was a student at the University of the Pacific that Pete met Glena Goranson who would become his wife. Pete, head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, played football, and Glena, a member of the team, played indoor volleyball.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Carroll’s first marriage was brief, but he and his current wife have three wonderful children. Brennan, their eldest son, also aspires to work in coaching for the sport of football. After assisting his father as a graduate assistant at USC, he took on his own coaching and recruiting responsibilities at the University of Miami, where he coached wide receivers.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her son went one route, but Jasmine followed in her footsteps by following Glena to USC, where she also played indoor volleyball. It’s therefore not shocking that Pete’s middle son, Nate, also went to USC and worked at Seahawk.</p><p style=text-align:justify>You can also join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a> to know more details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZeusLqNnKamZ6CawaZ5wpqpq6ecoXqpscign61n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nfl-week-10-survivor-picks-2023-targets-and-avoids-strategy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NFL Week 10 Survivor Picks 2023: Targets and Avoids Strategy">&larr;
