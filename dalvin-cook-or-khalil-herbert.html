I love that Mac Jones threw 54 times last week, 11 times to Bourne, and will likely have to approach that again tonight as New England hosts Miami. As good as the Dolphins are offensively, their defense leaves a lot to be desired. Jones isn’t Justin Herbert, but he genuinely seems to have taken a big step forward. Kirk also gets that juicy game script and a matchup with the Chiefs, but was an afterthought in Week 1 and already feels behind Calvin Ridley and Zay Jones. Kirk’s a guy I’m rooting for, but this week I trust Bourne more.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Pick One: Tyler Lockett, Zay Flowers or Puka Nacua</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Pick One: Tyler Lockett, Zay Flowers or Puka Nacua" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Rob Carr / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Pick One of Tyler Lockett, Zay Flowers or Puka Nacua</strong></p><p>The WR is a tough one. I can see all three having big games, especially since I think Seattle is a sneaky good option today. Also, how often do we see a receiver get 15 targets?! Not very. That said, Flowers is my play today. I think Baltimore will have to pass here, and Lamar Jackson showed a lot of trust in his uber-talented rookie in Week 1.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Pick one: Rachaad White, James Conner or David Montgomery</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Pick one: Rachaad White, James Conner or David Montgomery" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(David Berding / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Pick One of Rachaad White/James Conner/David Montgomery -Scott B.</strong></p><p>Lastly, I’m high on White; at home, great matchup, and game script.

George Pickens, Jahan Dotson or Garrett Wilson? Can’t believe this is now even a close question -Les G.</strong></p><p>The game moves fast. It’s a little easier with Pickens popping up on the injury report and not playing until Monday night. But honestly, it’s still Wilson. Go re-watch his TD catch…Zach Wilson just has to get the ball in his neighborhood and he’ll make it work. It is a tough matchup in Dallas, so don’t expect miracles, but Wilson is the best of this bunch.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Tyler Allgeier or Raheem Mostert?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Tyler Allgeier or Raheem Mostert?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Kevin C. Cox / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Tyler Allgeier or Raheem Mostert? -Scott L.</strong></p><p>I have to assume people are asking about Allgeier due to the presence of Bijan Robinson, but Allgeier is legit good. He rushed for over 1000 yards last season averaging 5.0 YPC and out-touched Robinson in Week 1. Both backs were Top 7 in rush yards over expected per attempt in Week 1. Atlanta is committed to this run-all-the-time approach, making both every week starts.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Deshaun Watson or Brock Purdy?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Deshaun Watson or Brock Purdy?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Gregory Shamus / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Deshaun Watson or Brock Purdy? -Adam R.</strong></p><p>I’m the biggest Purdy fan and one of the biggest Watson haters, so this isn’t a fair question for me, but I’ll put my personal feelings aside and tell you to start Watson. Purdy’s likely to be harassed by the Rams defense all afternoon and though I think he’ll find a way to get his two touchdowns today, the volume is likely to be lower. Watson plays Monday night in Pittsburgh, where Purdy just had a lot of success, and has the higher rushing upside of the two.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Pick two: James Conner, Joshua Kelley, Tyler Allgeier or Dameon Pierce</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Pick two: James Conner, Joshua Kelley, Tyler Allgeier or Dameon Pierce" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Kohjiro Kinno / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Pick two, PPR! James Conner, Joshua Kelley or Tyler Allgeier. Who knew this would be a dilemma? -Chad D. Same question but substitute Dameon Pierce for Allgeier, please. -Rick W.</strong></p><p>Joshua Kelley is a no-brainer for me. With Austin Ekeler out, he’s gold today. I mean, he was gold last week with Ekeler being amazing. I like Allgeier a lot too. Even though he’s in a time share and Conner really isn’t, Atlanta is going to keep running like crazy with him and Bijan Robinson. Pierce or Conner is a tougher choice. Both get favorable matchups, both are home in low-scoring game environments. Conner had slightly more volume in Week 1, in rushing attempts and targets, so I guess use that as the tie-breaker?</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Flex option: Jerry Jeudy, Mike Evans or Javonte Williams?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Flex option: Jerry Jeudy, Mike Evans or Javonte Williams?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(David Berding / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jerry Jeudy, Mike Evans or Javonte Williams for the final FLEX? Yardage (100, 150 etc) and long score (20/40 yd) bonuses. -T D.</strong></p><p>I love and hate those bonuses. Russell Wilson’s average intended air yards was 4.6 in Week 1. Keep that as far away from my bonuses as possible! Baker Mayfield’s AIAY was 7.5. Overall, I’m a bit higher on the Bucs than the Broncos today, in part because Chicago has been a fantasy-friendly passing matchup to start the season (third-best) and last year (sixth-best). Mike Evans is the guy you want, coming off a 10-target game, so even if you were hopeful about Jeudy’s volume, Evans should equal it in a better overall situation today.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Bounceback week for Rachaad White?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Bounceback week for Rachaad White?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Adam Bettcher / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Rachaad White or Tyler Allgeier? Then in the Flex either of the above or Romeo Doubs? -Luke O.</strong></p><p>I’d go with both running backs. Allgeier has a clearly defined volume role in the Falcons’ run game and the Packers offer little resistance to opposing running backs (fifth-most fantasy points to RBs in Week 1, ninth-most last season). White didn’t have a great Week 1, but 17 attempts and two targets is exactly what we want to see. At home vs. Chicago should be a much better day for him.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Joe Burrow vs. Tua Tagovailoa</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Joe Burrow vs. Tua Tagovailoa" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Ken Blaze / USA Today)</p><p><strong>Do I start Joe Burrow or Tua Tagovailoa? The Burrow injury worries me and I think it's close enough to ask if I'm overthinking it. — Hunter L.</strong></p><p>I pleaded with our lovely audience this summer to not put me — or you — in this position by recommending you not draft two startable QBs in a one-QB league. Sigh. I knew it was coming. … The matchups are similar, the team totals are identical, both have great receiving options. So, personally, I’m starting Burrow in a league and I believe he’ll be good today but if you’re leaning toward Tagovailoa I fully support it.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Good morning! Let's start answering your questions</h2><p>Good morning and welcome to Week 2! Tons of questions rolled in over the weekend and I’ve got the answers coming your way. Before we get to specifics, a couple of general thoughts on my guiding principles for Week 2.</p><p>I’m not going to tell you that every reaction to really good or really bad performances from Week 1 is an overreaction. There is a lot of actionable information coming out of our first "real" football.</p><p>I base my tough decisions on volume and matchup over anything else. I don’t think one game is enough to rely on for DvP, so I go back to 2022 numbers a lot.</p><p>I try not to let them get in my way, but I have my own player biases (questions about Deshaun Watson or Baker Mayfield might lead me to fall back on <a href=#>Jake’s rankings</a>).</p><p>If you don’t give me context, I’m assuming a 12-team, half-PPR league starting one QB.</p><p>Let’s get into it!</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Roschon Johnson, a Week 2 sleeper?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Roschon Johnson, a Week 2 sleeper?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>You’d have to be pretty desperate in an oversized league where you rostered all the wrong backs to move Roschon Johnson ahead of any of the consensus Top 36 backs… or to be so confident in the rest of your squad you can afford the risk. I’m confident there are both types in our audience, so here it is. Johnson didn’t get a lot of press given the Bears’ lackluster loss to Green Bay in Week 1, but he was quietly the best back for fantasy on his team. First of all, the Bears split 19 rushing plays and 15 targets three ways. Takeaway No. 1: Johnson was the most efficient with his carries, gaining an average 4.0 YPC. Takeaway No. 2: Johnson earned seven of the targets, catching six of them for 35 yards. Justin Fields tied Khalil Herbert with nine carries and bested all rushers in YPC (6.6). It’s a team that remains committed to the run, no question. There are a few RB injuries to watch this week, so while I don’t love the matchup with Tampa Bay, Johnson’s role in the pass game was sufficiently good that I could see moving him into Flex territory sooner rather than later.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Brain games: Patience with Geno Smith and Jamaal Williams; the realness of Mac Jones and more</p></a><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Patriots QB Mac Jones could be worth streaming vs. Miami</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Patriots QB Mac Jones could be worth streaming vs. Miami" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Eric Canha / USA Today)</p><p>I would have bet pretty much anything I owned that someone other than Mac Jones would lead Week 1 in pass attempts, so I’m glad no one made me that offer. It wasn’t enough to beat the Eagles in a gross weather game, but that almost makes it stand out even more. He completed a respectable 65 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and one interception. Kendrick Bourne and Hunter Henry were the major targets and beneficiaries of this high pass volume, accounting for all three scores. Jones threw for over 300 yards twice last season and hit the 3-TD mark only once — against Buffalo in a meaningless Week 18 game. Bill Belichick told us Jones had improved physically and mentally, but I guess we’re too conditioned to ignore his coachspeak because no one saw this coming. If you need an Aaron Rodgers replacement, I’m good with the idea of starting Jones at home vs. Miami. The Dolphins were the second-best QB matchup last year and Justin Herbert certainly looked fine against them in Week 1.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Brain games: Patience with Geno Smith and Jamaal Williams; the realness of Mac Jones and more</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Bounceback week for Jamaal Williams?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Bounceback week for Jamaal Williams?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Stephen Lew / USA Today)</p><p>Jamaal Williams was disappointing from a fantasy perspective even as the Saints edged the Titans in Week 1. With no Alvin Kamara or Kendre Miller, and an improved pass attack that could move down the field, I expected Williams to score at least once. He did get 18 carries and two targets, which is why I’m not so worried. The Titans run defense was the third-best against running backs last season and looked every bit as stout in the opener. Week 2 gives Williams a much better shot at fantasy goodness, however. The Saints play the Panthers on Monday night. Carolina just gave up great games to both Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier. Both scored — Allgeier with two touchdowns on the ground and Robinson with one through the air — and both averaged over 5.0 YPC. Look for an uptick in Williams’ fantasy numbers for Week 2 as your RB3 or Flex.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Brain games: Patience with Geno Smith and Jamaal Williams; the realness of Mac Jones and more</p></a><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Don't overthink the Bengals in Week 2</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Don't overthink the Bengals in Week 2" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Ken Blaze / USA Today)</p><p>I lost a fantasy matchup to a lineup that started Drake London and Rashaad Penny, y’all. This was difficult to watch, but I’m already doing my best to forget their combined nine fantasy points.</p><p>It made me feel a little better to dig up some dirt on Joe Burrow. He’s 1-3 in season openers and 1-5 vs. the Browns, which could mean the worst is behind us. Looking forward, Burrow will be one more week removed from the calf strain he dealt with during the preseason and facing a team (Baltimore) that he’s put up all-time numbers against in the past. It was December 2021 when Burrow threw for 525 yards and four touchdowns against the Ravens. Now a worst-to-first script like that is unlikely for Week 2, but I do think the Bengals will bounce back at home in a potential pass-happy game. The over/under is 46.5 points and Cincinnati is favored by 3.5 points early in the week, which means that bettors are counting on Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase to post much better numbers vs. Baltimore. Protecting Burrow from another bruising pash rush has to be priority No. 1 for the Bengals this week.</p><p>Load more updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46fmKeskajGbrLOqKubmZyherixxKRka2WRmcOqr8RoiI99eoiQiMXKqX2AZ3iOk4W9lG%2BNcmyjq3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fame-lili-simmons-net-worth-and-salary-income-estimation-jan-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Lili Simmons net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
