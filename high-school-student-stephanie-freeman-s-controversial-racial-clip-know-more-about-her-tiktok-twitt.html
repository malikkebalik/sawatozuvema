The clip later went viral and got lots of criticism and backlashes on Twitter.</p><p>In that video, the two enter a restroom, and the camera pans to a piece of paper with a racist slur engraved on it resting on top of the sink drain. The two students then pour glasses of water over the paper, which has various insulting labels that make negative remarks about black people.</p><p>Later, someone posted Hume and Freeman's video on Twitter which went viral in a short time. After that, they both received criticism from all over the country. As a result, the<a href=# rel=nofollow> pair were also expelled</a> by their college.</p><p>Carrollton High school released a statement about the incident, which read:</p><p><i><strong>“Parents, tonight it has been brought to my attention that an inappropriate video was created on the TikTok social media platform by students at Carrollton High School. Please know this video is being addressed immediately and any student involved in the production of this video will face serious consequences. Carrollton City Schools top priority is the health and well-being of our students and this type of behavior will not be tolerated.”</strong></i></p><p>Stephanie and Jeffery were both expelled by their college as Carrollton High School stated that their behavior was unacceptable.&nbsp;</p><h2>How is Stephanie Freeman's Love Life?
