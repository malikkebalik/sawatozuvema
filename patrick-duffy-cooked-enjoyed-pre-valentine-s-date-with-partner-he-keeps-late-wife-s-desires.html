He revealed he would celebrate Valentine's Day with his longtime love, actress Linda Purl.</p><p class=dh>The pair are not yet married, but they have been married to other people before being together. Duffy is a widower, having lost his one and only wife of 43 years, Carlyn Rosser, in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b034b57a1fc64b01a4c58c4ec170b6a6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Patrick Duffy and his wife dancer Carlyn Rosser attend the 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards at Walt Disney Studios on January 1, 1999 in Burbank, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Rosser passed away from cancer at age 77 and left behind her husband and their two sons, Padriac and Conor. <a class="me a" href=#>Duffy</a> candidly talked about the passing of his beloved spouse in November 2019. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patrick-duffy-still-considers-himself-married-after-wifes-death/>divulged</a> that he felt her presence everywhere, proving their strong connection to each other:</p><p class=dh>"I can hear her. I can see her. I know what she would expect of me, and I try and live up to that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/625b1577d3364e82ab44b7ea7d246f19.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Duffy and Carlyn Rosser during the Monte Carlo Television Festival 2002 - Independence Day Party on July 4, 2002 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At the time, Duffy admitted that he had not yet come to terms with Rosser's death, although she had been gone for two years. The director <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patrick-duffy-still-considers-himself-married-after-wifes-death/>said</a> he doubted whether he would move on, adding that for him, he was still very much married:</p><p class=dh>"I feel close to her all the time [but] what I miss most is her touch. I still consider myself a married man."</p><p class=dh>Duffy recounted when the couple first crossed paths and revealed Rosser was older than him. "I was an immature college graduate touring as a narrator with this dance production. She was a beautiful ballerina ten years older. We met on the tour bus, and that was it â€“ for life," he recalled.</p><p class=dh>Rosser and Duffy's chemistry was so intense that they never even saw themselves dating other people. That strong feeling contributed to his struggle to move on without her after she died.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Does Duffy Live Up to His Late Wife's Desires?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Despite feeling pessimistic about being with someone other than his late wife, <a class="me a" href=#>Duffy</a> eventually fell in love again. He frankly discussed his love life in November 2020 and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/tv/dallas-patrick-duffy-is-dating-happy-days-linda-purl/>told</a> People that he never expected things to pan out this way for him:</p><p class=dh>"I'm in an incredibly happy relationship."</p><p class=dh>The "Step by Step" alum stated, "I never thought I'd feel this way again." When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Duffy found himself all alone amid quarantine but became used to his life as a widower.</p><p class=dh>Little did he know that it would turn into a joyful period in his life. He and Purl were casual friends back in the day but lost touch. The pair reconnected on a group text chain, and Duffy made the first move by driving to her house.</p><p class=dh>The Hollywood star said he wanted to see whether the connection they developed through texts "was real." After that encounter, the two have been inseparable ever since.</p><p class=dh>Duffy <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.people.com/tv/dallas-patrick-duffy-is-dating-happy-days-linda-purl/>mentioned</a> that having given love a second chance, Rosser would want him to find happiness with someone else. He added that he is living up to her expectations:</p><p class=dh>"I feel, quite honestly, that it is keeping with the desires of my wife, the fact that we are intended to be happy."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Was Duffy's Pre-Valentine Date with His Partner?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Duffy does appear to be happy, judging by his social media uploads. He posted a picture of the couple with genuine smiles and sparkles in their eyes on a date at the beach. "Sunset beach date," he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CodPCNAy90J/>captioned</a> the photo.</p><p class=dh>Duffy and Purl are doting parents and grandparents and enjoy spending time together. He often bakes for the family and even bakes cookies, as the pair will appear on the "Tamron Hall Show" for <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CokxlGvBSeA/>Valentine's Day.</a></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Duffy</a>, a granddad of four, shared a video on Instagram, showing him preparing the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CnQ3K3Tgg_Q/>Duffy's Dough cinnamon</a> rolls to give to TV host Tamron Hall during their visit to the show.</p><p class=dh>In addition, the couple often shows affection on their social media.
