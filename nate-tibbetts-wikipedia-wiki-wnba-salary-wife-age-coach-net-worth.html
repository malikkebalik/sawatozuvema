The Phoenix Mercury has taken a bold step by bringing in Orlando Magic assistant coach Nate Tibbetts as their new head coach. It’s not just any move; it’s a groundbreaking one. Nate Tibbetts is set to become the highest-paid coach in the history of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA). This hiring marks a significant change, not only for the Mercury but also for the WNBA itself. Let’s delve into the details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nate-Tibbetts-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Nate_Tibbetts></span><strong>Who is Nate Tibbetts?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nate Tibbetts, who recently made headlines with his new role, is no stranger to the basketball world. His journey through the world of basketball has been nothing short of impressive. He’s been serving as an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic since 2021, learning the ropes under the guidance of head coach Jamahl Mosley.</p><p>However, his journey doesn’t begin or end with the Magic. Before his time with the Magic, Tibbetts shared his coaching expertise with teams like the Portland Trail Blazers and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Not only did he make his mark in the NBA, but he also honed his skills in the G League. You can find his coaching footprint with the Tulsa 66ers and the Sioux Falls Skyforce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nate-tibbetts-c9752d23a3ac8221-833x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Change_in_Direction></span><strong>A Change in Direction</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nate Tibbetts is taking the helm of a Phoenix Mercury team that faced a challenging season, finishing at the bottom of the league with a 9-31 record. The team’s performance during the previous season led to the departure of former coach Vanessa Nygaard, and the franchise decided not to retain interim coach Nikki Blue. This change signifies the Mercury’s desire to chart a new course and bring about a fresh start.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Influence_of_General_Manager_Nick_URen></span><strong>The Influence of General Manager Nick U’Ren</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The decision to hire Nate Tibbetts as head coach didn’t happen in isolation. The new general manager, Nick U’Ren, played a crucial role in this significant move. U’Ren, who joined the franchise during the previous summer, comes with an impressive background in basketball operations, having spent nine years with the Golden State Warriors. Nate Tibbetts’ appointment as head coach is U’Ren’s first significant move since taking on the role of general manager. It reflects the direction and vision that U’Ren brings to the Mercury.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tibbetts_Transition_to_the_WNBA></span><strong>Tibbetts’ Transition to the WNBA</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Nate Tibbetts has a wealth of experience in the NBA, the WNBA is uncharted territory for him. Taking on the role of head coach for the Mercury, he faces the challenge of adapting to the women’s game. However, this hiring is in line with a recent trend in the WNBA, where coaches with NBA backgrounds are making a significant impact. He joins the ranks of coaches like Becky Hammon and Teresa Weatherspoon, who have successfully transitioned from the NBA to the women’s league. Importantly, Hammon and Weatherspoon have the added advantage of having been former WNBA players themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nate-tibbetts-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mat_Ishbias_Commitment_to_the_Franchise></span><strong>Mat Ishbia’s Commitment to the Franchise</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The hiring of Nate Tibbetts and the reported salary that comes with it are clear indicators of owner Mat Ishbia’s commitment to the Mercury. Ishbia took over as the franchise’s owner in February and has been leaving no stone unturned to transform the Mercury into a powerhouse in the league. The Mercury recently announced plans for a state-of-the-art practice facility worth over $100 million, designed for both the Mercury and the Phoenix Suns. This ambitious move is set to raise the bar for facilities in the league, providing the team with world-class resources.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_New_Approach_to_Broadcasting></span><strong>A New Approach to Broadcasting</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In addition to significant investments in infrastructure, Mat Ishbia has made a groundbreaking announcement regarding broadcasting. Starting from the next season, the Mercury will broadcast their games for free on television and through a new service called Kiswe, moving away from Bally Sports Arizona. This change is expected to make the games more accessible to fans and expand the reach of the Mercury’s matches.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hosting_the_2024_WNBA_All-Star_Game></span><strong>Hosting the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another exciting development for the franchise is the opportunity to host the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game. This major event will shine a spotlight on the Mercury and bring fans from all over the league to celebrate the best players in the women’s game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1128586651.0-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Offseason_Questions_for_the_Mercury></span><strong>Offseason Questions for the Mercury</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>As the Mercury looks to bounce back from a challenging season, several key questions are on everyone’s minds:</strong></p><ul><li>Diana Taurasi’s Future: Diana Taurasi, a legendary figure in women’s basketball, is under contract for another season. Her commitment to the franchise is unwavering, and she had kind words for interim coach Nikki Blue. Taurasi believes that Blue has the qualities to be a great head coach, praising her ability to inspire and lead the team.</li><li>Brittney Griner’s Free Agency: Brittney Griner, a dominant force in the league, is a free agent. The good news for the Mercury is that she has expressed her intention to stay with the team next season. Her decision will be vital in shaping the Mercury’s future.</li><li>Skylar Diggins-Smith’s Status: Skylar Diggins-Smith took maternity leave during the past season, and her future with the Mercury is still uncertain. General Manager Nick U’Ren and the organization have remained tight-lipped about her status, leaving fans eager to know what’s next for this talented guard.</li><li>Notable Free Agents: In addition to Griner, there are other notable free agents on Mercury’s roster, including Shey Peddy, Megan Gustafson, and Sug Sutton. The decisions about these players will significantly impact the team’s composition for the next season.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nate_Tibbetts_Social_Media_Accounts></span><strong>Nate Tibbetts</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Social Media Accounts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The hiring of Nate Tibbetts as the new head coach of the Phoenix Mercury marks an exciting chapter in the franchise’s history. It also reflects the WNBA’s evolving landscape, with more coaches from the NBA making the leap to the women’s game. With Mat Ishbia’s significant investments in the franchise and the promise of a brighter future, the Mercury is poised to rebound and make its mark in the league once again. The 2024 WNBA All-Star Game, combined with the commitment of key players like Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner, sets the stage for an exciting season ahead.</p><p>Nate Tibbetts’ journey and the changes taking place in the Mercury organization are making waves in the basketball world. It’s a story of transformation, new beginnings, and the ongoing evolution of the WNBA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQ></span><strong>FAQ</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Nate_Tibbetts_current_role_in_the_WNBA></span><strong>What is Nate Tibbetts’ current role in the WNBA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nate Tibbetts is currently the head coach of the Phoenix Mercury in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA).</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_Nate_Tibbetts_coaching_credentials_in_the_NBA></span><strong>What are Nate Tibbetts’ coaching credentials in the NBA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before his WNBA coaching role, Nate Tibbetts worked as an assistant coach in the NBA with teams like the Orlando Magic, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Portland Trail Blazers.</p><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Nate_Tibbetts_transition_from_the_NBA_to_the_WNBA></span><strong>How did Nate Tibbetts transition from the NBA to the WNBA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nate Tibbetts transitioned to coaching in the WNBA after gaining valuable experience in the NBA.
