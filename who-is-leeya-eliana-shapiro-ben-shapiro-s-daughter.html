The father of the 9 years old, who was born with congenital heart disease and an atrial septal defect, is a political commentator, radio personality, writer, and columnist.</strong></p><p>Ben Shapiro hosts a political radio show on Regular Wire titled The Ben Shapiro Show and has featured and made notable appearances on many other radio shows. He has also authored many books, such as Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans, What’s Fair and Other Short Stories, and a host of others.</p><h3><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s Biography Summary</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b><span>Leeya Eliana Shapiro</span></li><li><b>Gender:</b><span> Female</span></li><li><b>Date of Birth: </b><span>January 28, 2014</span></li><li><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s Age:</b><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>9 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b><span>White/Caucasian</span></li><li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b><span>Aquarius</span></li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b><span>Straight</span></li><li><b>Religion: </b><span>Orthodox Jewish</span></li><li><b>Marital Status: </b><span>Single</span></li><li><b>Hair Colour: </b><span>Auburn</span></li><li><b>Eye Colour: </b><span>Blue</span></li><li><b>Siblings: </b><span>One Brother</span></li><li><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s Mother: </b><span>Mor Shapiro</span></li><li><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s Father: </b><span>Ben Shapiro</span></li><li><b>Famous for:</b><span> Being Ben Shapiro’s first child</span></li></ul><h2><b>How Old is Leeya Eliana Shapiro Now?</b></h2><p>Leeya Eliana Shapiro was born into a Jewish Christian family some 9 years ago in Los Angeles, California, USA. She is the first child of renowned American conservative political commentator, writer, and nationally syndicated columnist, Ben Shapiro born on 28th January 2014.</p><p>Her mother, Mor Shapiro, spent 26 hours in the labor room before she was born, and Leeya came out as a 7-pound, 9-ounce, 21-inch child suffering from congenital heart disease, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>atrial septal defect</a> with major symptoms like bluish skin, tiredness, and reduced weight. In 2015, the following year, she was admitted to the Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles to undergo open heart surgery.</p><p>The operation was performed by one of the accomplished cardiac surgeons, and it was quite successful because Leeya Eliana Shapiro has recovered completely from the life-threatening disease and is enjoying her life with her family in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/ezgif.com-gif-maker-4-1.jpg><h3><strong>What was Her Childhood Like?</strong></h3><p>Aside from the Open surgery that Leeya Eliana Shapiro had in 2015, she most definitely enjoyed the love and affection from her parents. Just a week after her birth, her dad gained permission from his wife and wrote an open letter on Twitter to gush about how her birth brought them joy and how she was calm and sweet.</p><p>Ben Shapiro described how she was the manifestation of the love between him and his wife. He added that all those late-night feedings and sleep deprivation were all worth it as they were excited to be parents for the first time.</p><p>However, not so much is known about Leeya, like the school she is attending and if she was homeschooled or not. She has gathered public attention through her dad’s openness on social media. He never wasted an opportunity to show how proud he is of his family. Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s parents kept their daughter subsequently from the public eye because they rarely upload pictures of her on social media except for pictures of her when she was pretty young, but as she grows, we see little or no pictures of her online.</p><h3><strong>Leeya Eliana Shapiro is Being Raised in the Jewish Religious Beliefs</strong></h3><p>Ben Shapiro and Mor Shapiro are devout Jews. This may account for why they specifically gave their first daughter a Hebrew name. Leeya is a Hebrew name that means, ‘I belong to God, and her middle name ‘Eliana,’ is also a Hebrew name that means ‘God has answered my prayers.’ Leeya’s parents have high hopes in leading their daughter to God as could be seen in the choice of the name they gave her.</p><p>In the open letter Ben Shapiro wrote after she was born, he clearly stated that Leeya is the future of Jewish people and the American people, and they are preserving God’s word and his freedom for the next generation. No contrary beliefs have been entertained so far from Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s side.</p><h2><strong>What is the Relationship Between Leeya Shapiro’s Parents Like?</strong></h2><p>Ben Shapiro met Mor when she was still a student at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. They dated for quite some years before they got engaged in 2007. Their engagement was announced, and because they believed in Orthodox Judaism/ Jewish, they had their traditional Jewish marriage function in Acre, Israel.</p><p>The couple is still together to date and seems to have a pleasant marriage. They have not been involved in any marriage or relationship crisis, even though Ben is often on the news for his somewhat controversial stand on certain national issues.</p><h3><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro Might not be Ben and Mor Shapiro’s Only Child</b></h3><p>Ben Shapiro and Mor Shapiro have pretty much kept their children out of the public eye. After the birth of Leeya Eliana Shapiro, it was rumored that the couple had another child, a son, in 2016 but was kept sternly from the public as his name and other vital information about him are not available. It was also reported that there is a third sibling, which both Ben Shapiro and Mor Shapiro have not confirmed to date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/ezgif.com-gif-maker-3-1-1024x744.jpg><h2><strong>What is Leeya Eliana Shapiro’s Chosen Career Path?</strong></h2><p>The young girl has not trod any career path yet. Her goals, interests, and abilities are unknown at the moment. As a minor, less than eighteen years, Leeya is not on any social media platforms, but her parents have an active account on Instagram and Twitter, but they rarely upload pictures of her.</p><p>No one can guess what career path Leeya Eliana Shapiro would like to take in life, but subsequently, it will unfold.</p><h3><b>Leeya Eliana Shapiro is Living Off Her Parent’s Net Worth</b></h3><p>Leeya Shapiro recently clocked eight years old as of January 2022. As a result, she is very young to earn a living for herself and doesn’t have a professional career yet, making it a bit difficult for her to have an estimated net worth.</p><p>However, her parents are quite wealthy as her father Ben Shapiro is estimated to have a net worth of $20 million. According to reports, he has annual earnings of about $65,000, while Mor Shapiro’s income is an estimated amount of around $400,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdobKmxcBmnKWhkaOubr%2FHmqeiqp9ir6a6jKyfmqiZp7y0ecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wiki-career-husband-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wiki, Career, Husband &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
