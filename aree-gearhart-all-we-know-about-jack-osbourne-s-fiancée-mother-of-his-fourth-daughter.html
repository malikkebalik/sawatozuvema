Learn more about Aree Gearhart, Jack Osborne's wife and the mother of his fourth child.</p><p class=dh>Jack Osborne and his fiancée welcomed their child into the world on July 9, 2022. This beautiful moment was a long way from March when he took to his Instagram to let his fans know that his future wife, Aree Gearhart, was pregnant.</p><p class=dh>From the beginning of the pregnancy, the excited Gearhart shared many moments with her followers, taking pictures of her journey towards motherhood. One of the most adorable pictures they shared was Gearhart's announcement of the birth of their baby.</p><p class=dh>The Instagram post of the baby shared on July 29, 2022, pictured the little girl lying down and giving the camera an adorable look with her dark eyes. The caption <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CghjMYDJeSy/>read</a>:</p><p class=dh>"my soulmate, Maple Artemis Osbourne, came to us earth side on July 9, 2022 at 8:07pm. new level of love unlocked [sic]."</p><p class=dh>People in the comment section congratulated Osbourne and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11055253/Jack-Osbournes-fianc-e-Aree-Gearhart-welcomes-child-together.html>his fiancée</a> on their new baby girl, with heart emojis flying in from all directions. The post has received around 3500 likes so far.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS AREE GEARHART, JACK OSBOURNE'S BABY MAMA?</strong></p><p class=dh>Osbourne and Gearhart, an interior designer, were spotted together for the first time in November 2019 at the American Music Awards. His hands were linked with what was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/jack-osbourne-new-girlfriend-amas-2019/>termed</a> a "mystery woman." This mysterious individual ended up engaged and having Osbourne's baby.</p><p class=dh>In December of 2021, Osbourne announced their engagement with a selfie of them in front of a snowy backdrop. Gearhart's hand lay on her fiancé's chest, showing off her gorgeous engagement ring. Her future husband <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CYIFl--PIvm/>wrote</a> in the caption:</p><p class=dh>"Today I asked the most beautiful and loving woman I’ve ever met to marry me. She said yes!! Life is a series of doors, and I’m so excited to walk through this one with her. She’s truly a magical being with a heart bigger then anything I could have imagined."</p><p class=dh>Gearhart is a great addition to the Osbourne family and, as her fiancé once stated, is a great stepmother to his children from his previous marriage. She has spent <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/jack-osbourne-announces-engagement-girlfriend-aree-gearhart-rcna10581>significant time </a>with them during family reunions and holidays.</p><p class=dh>Osbourne shared a picture of himself on vacation with the three kids, his parents, and Gearhart, who all looked relaxed and happy. In the caption, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CEfzYHEhAqY/>wrote</a>, "Vacation vibes! #summer2020."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS JACK OSBOURNE'S EX-WIFE LISA STELLY?</strong></p><p class=dh>Lisa Stelly, born in the mid-1980s, is a model and actress; she is mainly recognized for the parts she played in the band "<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3481174/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Green Day's" music videos</a> such as "Last of the American Girls" and "21 Guns."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Minnie contracted COVID-19 in 2020 when she was 2½ years old.</strong></h3><p class=dh>She is also a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2021/12/31/lisa-stelly/>business owner</a> and founded "Fancy Sprinkles." It is a sprinkle store that helps individuals with event decorations and sells a variety of desserts.</p><p class=dh>Osbourne and Stelly married in Hawai in 2012 after they began dating in 2011 but eventually went their separate ways in 2017. A little while before they exchanged vows, they had Pearl, after which, while wed, Stelly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jack-osbournes-kids-see-his-3-children-with-ex-wife-lisa-stelly/>suffered a miscarriage</a> in her second trimester.</p><p class=dh>Following this, they had Andy in 2015. Then, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yourtango.com/2019322436/who-lisa-stelly-new-details-jack-osbornes-wife-finalized-divorce>in 2018, Stelly filed </a>for divorce, and it eventually became fully official in 2019. Minnie was born a few months after Stelly filed for the legal split.</p><p class=dh>An insider said they did everything they could to preserve the relationship, but nothing worked, and they had grown apart. However, while they may not have worked out, the two have pushed to maintain a healthy relationship with their kids as healthy co-parents.</p><p class=dh>Their firstborn Pearl is now around ten years old, has a feisty personality, and loves scary films, while the 7-year-old Andy is described as unique. Osbourne has spoken about her unusual behavior, relaying that she believed diapers were fire at one point and wouldn't wear her clothes.</p><p class=dh>Not much seems to be known about 4-year-old Minnie except that she has been on tour with her dad so he could film and had to go into quarantine at a young age. Her father said he was preparing her for her first van adventure.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MINNIE BATTLES WITH COVID-19</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Minnie</a> contracted COVID-19 in 2020 when she was 2½ years old from someone that works for her dad. Osbourne stated that she sipped a glass of water that one of the staff, who had the virus, was drinking out. Osbourne said this individual didn't tell him he had contracted Coronavirus.</p><p class=dh>At the time, the dad reported that his little girl only showed mild symptoms such as a fever and a runny nose for three consecutive days. On top of this, her condition seemed to be improving.</p><p class=dh>Osbourne's mother pointed out that her granddaughter falling sick from COVID-19 shows that children are not necessarily safe from the virus. As is currently clear, Minnie survived.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbGpnaXqivsSeZKCdkae1or7TZpilpF2ssm63zaiuZqKRmLhuu9Kbpq6qnprAb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kacie-mcdonnell-net-worth-weight-bio-age-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kacie McDonnell Net Worth, Weight, Bio, Age, Height">&larr;
