The <a href=#>action series</a> is a creation of Shawn Ryan and will appeal to conspiracy thrillers fans. One of the show’s prominent stars is Louis Gabriel Basso III, AKA Gabriel Basso, who shines as FBI Agent Peter Sutherland. The actor’s portrayal of the lead character allows the audience to immerse themselves in a story and root for him to find the answers he wants. This has made many in the public more curious about Gabriel’s personal life and romantic interests. Luckily, we are here to explore and share what we know about the same!</p><h2>Gabriel Basso’s Age, Family, and Background</h2><p>On December 11, 1994, Gabriel was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents, Marcie and Louis J Basso Jr, homeschooled their son and two daughters, Alexandra and Annalise Basso. The family was seemingly quite faithful and attended the Grace Doctrine Church. Initially, Gabriel wanted to be a football player and hopefully pursue a path as a professional athlete. However, he soon discovered acting and made a name for himself. According to the Netflix star, he is still passionate about football and has not entirely let go of his childhood dream.</p><p>During the starting years of his career, Gabriel participated in various projects. His most well-known works include ‘<a href=#>iCarly</a>,’ ‘Ghost Town,’ and ‘Alabama Moon,’ ‘Eastwick.’ The talented actor’s big break came in 2010 due to his portrayal of Adam Jamison in Showtime’s ‘The Big C.’ Since then, he has been featured in movies like ‘The Kings of Summer,’ ‘The Hive,’ ‘Barely Lethal,’ and ‘Ithaca.’ In 2016, he was seen in a prominent role in ‘<a href=#>The Whole Truth</a>.’ The film stars renowned artists like <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> and <a href=#>Renée Zellweger</a>.</p><p>Given Gabriel’s impressive list of works, it is no wonder he garnered so much attention due to his work on the Netflix project. However, acting is not the only form of creative expression that the artist enjoys as he is also an accomplished musician with over nine years of training in violin. Besides, Gabriel is exceptionally skilled on a guitar and enjoys taking musical breaks between intense periods of work. Additionally, the television star is a breathtaking illustrator; his work can be seen on his dedicated Instagram page. In fact, beloved actor Keanu Reeves owns one of his illustrated pieces, something that ‘The Night Agent’ could not help but share in August 2022.</p><h2>Is Gabriel Basso Dating Anyone?</h2><p>A private person by nature, Gabriel has not shared any details of his romantic life with the public. That said, the actor does have a daughter whom he first talked about on Instagram in August 2020. He <a href=#>stated</a>, “There’s a new Basso on the planter” via the social media platform. Yet, as of writing, the actor has decided to keep his child’s name confidential. He has also not given any information about another parent.</p><p>The bond between Gabriel and his daughter certainly seems to be flourishing. In a social media post from February 2023, he could not help but <a href=#>share</a> “A glimpse into the pit of insanity. If you live in the midst of chaos, your thinking becomes chaotic and disorganized. Indeed. That is my ultimate secret to remaining inhumanly tense and on edge. Always keep yourself guessing so that your enemies and rivals won’t have any idea what your next move will be. Always wear your gi. And always possess wrist control when addressing a toddler.” Despite the dramatic nature of the caption, the sentiment makes people happy about Gabriel’s role as a father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmoqtdnK6jvsieo2aakajAsHnDmquippdixKm7jKKqZqCZqHqotdGlnauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robbie-graham-kuntz-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robbie Graham-Kuntz Net Worth">&larr;
