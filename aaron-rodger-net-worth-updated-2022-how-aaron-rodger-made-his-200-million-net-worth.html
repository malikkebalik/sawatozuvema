I&nbsp;am blessed that my dad is a chiropractor. Getting adjusted regularly – along with practicing other good health habits that my mom helped me to establish – are all part of my goal to win in life and on the field.”&nbsp;</p><p class="quote clearfix">“I try to be as courteous as possible and sometimes try to tell my fans that as much as I appreciate their support, there are times where I need to be able to have an uninterrupted dinner or not have to take a bunch of pictures or just be able to do some of the normal things.”</p><p class="quote clearfix">“The thing you realize as you get older and you play, that you don’t really understand when you’re a backup the first few off-seasons, how important that mental rest is. It’s a grind physically during the season, dealing with the hits and the physical pain that goes with playing in this game. But mentally it’s probably more taxing, so you need that ability to find that escape.”&nbsp;</p><p class="quote clearfix">“Playing behind the first-ballot Hall of Famer, who also is the all-time record holder for consecutive starts by a quarterback, it’s a different mindset. You just have to challenge yourself in ways that you never challenged yourself before.”</p><h2>How Much Does Aaron Rodgers Make For Appearing In State Farm Ads?</h2><p>Forbes says that Aaron Rodgers makes between $2 and $3 million a year from State Farm.</p><h2>Which Companies Does Aaron Rodgers Own?</h2><p>In 2018, the star quarterback acquired a minority share in the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association.
