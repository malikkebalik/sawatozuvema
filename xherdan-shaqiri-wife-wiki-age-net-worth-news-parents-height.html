Despite interest from other teams, he chose to remain with Basel, when he played for their reserve team in the Swiss 1. Liga from 2007 to 2009. Two years later, on 2 January 2009, Shaqiri signed a first professional deal with Basel, which kept them at St. Jakob-Park until December 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2-1 victory over Manchester United in December 2011, Shaqiri contributed two assists. &nbsp;For the second time in his Basel career, he won a Double, consisting of the League title&nbsp;and the Swiss Cup, at the end of the 2011-12 season.</p><p>Shaqiri made his under-21 debut for Switzerland on November 11, 2009, in a 3-1 win over Turkey in a 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier.

He scored the game-winning goal as Switzerland rallied from behind to overcome Serbia 2-1 in the group stage. He and his teammate, Kosovar-born Granit Xhaka, celebrated their goals with only an eagle gesture, a symbol for ethnic Albanians. Switzerland captain Stephan Lichtsteiner, who isn't really of Albanian ancestry, made the identical motion to celebrate Shaqiri's goal and afterward supported both players. Xhaka and Shaqiri were fined 10,000 Swiss francs by FIFA for "unsporting behavior according to the rules of fair play," while Lichtsteiner was fined 5,000 Swiss francs.</p><h3><strong>Xherdan Shaqiri Wife- Biography & Wiki</strong></h3><p>Shaqiri was born to Kosovar Albanian parents in Zhegr, Gjilan, SFR Yugoslavia.

Their mother worked as just a cleaner in city office buildings, which he and his brothers assisted with. His father would take as much money as he could over to Kosovo to other relatives, which meant that Xherdan and his family had no additional spending money saved for birthdays. &nbsp;He admired Brazilian attacker Ronaldo, whom he described as "playing like magic."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read:-&nbsp;<a href=#>Christopher Bell Wife</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Xherdan Shaqiri&nbsp; Wife, Wiki, Age, &nbsp;Net Worth, News,&nbsp; Parents, Height</strong></h3><table border=1><tbody readability=1.965844402277><tr><td><p>Real Name</p></td><td><p>Xherdan Shaqiri</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nick Name</p></td><td><p>Xherdan</p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p>Profession Build</p></td><td readability=5><p>Swiss Professional Footballer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Date of Birth</p></td><td><p>10 october,1991</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birth Place</p></td><td><p>Gjilan</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Current Age</p></td><td><p>31</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Marital Status</p></td><td><p>Not Married &nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Girlfriend Name</p></td><td><p>Dhurata Ahmetaj</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Current Net worth</p></td><td><p>$12 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Height&nbsp;</p></td><td><p>5’7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weight in Kg</p></td><td><p>72 kg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hair Colour</p></td><td><p>Black</p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p>High School</p></td><td readability=5><p>All Saints Catholic High School</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>University</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Qualification</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ethnicity</p></td><td><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zodiac Sign</p></td><td><p>Libra</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Islam</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nationality</p></td><td><p>Kosovar, Swiss</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sibling’s</p></td><td><p>Erdin, Arianit</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Parents</p></td><td><p>Fatime, Isen</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Category</p></td><td><p><a href=#>Biography</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Xherdan Shaqiri - Parents & Siblings</strong></h3><p><img alt="Xherdan Shaqiri Parents " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1670063866.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He moved to Switzerland with his parents and three siblings in 1992. &nbsp;His younger brother, Arianit Shaqiri, coaches kids' football. &nbsp;They settled at Augst, a little village on the French and German borders in the canton of Basel-Country.<strong></strong></p><p>Shaqiri is a Muslim, yet he celebrates Christmas, despite the fact that it is primarily a Christian event.
