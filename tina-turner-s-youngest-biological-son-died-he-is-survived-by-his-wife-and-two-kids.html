Turner revealed what may have contributed to the death of one of her sons years ago.</p><p class=dh>She posted on Twitter in July 2018 announcing the passing of her eldest child, Craig Raymond Turner, who took his own life. Tina shared a photo of her and her loved ones on a boat as she held a red rose and was about to throw it into the ocean.

Tina shared his son had only begun working at his "new job and had found love."</p><p class=dh>Craig had told his mother about his new partner and how strongly he felt about her. He even planned to introduce them and was "happy" about his new job.

[..] But [..]why didn't he call the new girlfriend that gave him the lift?"</p><p class=dh>The retired singer described Craig, who she welcomed in her teens with saxophonist Raymond Hill, as reserved and "very shy."</p><p class=dh>Craig once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tina-turner-hbo-documentary-fails-absence-mother-source>revealed</a> that his mother was "strict," especially when she was "home" with them.

She acknowledged that they "needed more" of her attention.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Tina</a> is married to her second husband, actor, and producer Erwin Bach, whom she wed in 2013. The couple has since relocated to Europe, leading Tina to leave all her sons behind.</p><p class=dh>In August 2018, one of her adopted sons, Ike Jr., disclosed that she had abandoned the family in the United States for her life in Europe. The music superstar brought him up from the age of two. That said, "She's the only mother I've ever known," <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5669995/Tina-turned-family-claims-adopted-son-Ike-Junior.html>said</a> the musician.</p><p class=dh>He added the last time they were in contact was perhaps in the year 2000 and that it was less likely that his brothers had also managed to stay in touch with her.</p><p class=dh>On December 9, 2022, Tina <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9Y5HtDRav/>revealed</a> on Instagram that her youngest son, Ronnie, had died. The actress posted a black and white picture of herself with her eyes closed and captioned it:</p><p class=dh>"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow, I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son."</p><p class=dh>Police reportedly received a 911 call from someone who said Ronnie was outside their house and had trouble breathing.

The source divulged he and his wife, Afida Turner, thought the biography was "well done."</p><p class=dh>Although they gave "credit" to his dad as a "successful" performer, the couple felt saddened that Ronnie was not a part of the documentary featuring his parents.</p><p class=dh>The said source speculated that the reason why Ronnie did not appear in the film was "because it was produced by Erwin."</p><p class=dh>On December 8, 2022, Afida paid tribute to her now-late beloved husband on Instagram, sharing a snapshot of him holding a microphone.</p><p class=dh>"My God, Ronnie Turner, a true angel, huge soul, highly spiritual.

The French musician recently shared a snap alongside Ronnie and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCK1SypRht/>expressed</a> shock and deep "sadness" at his death.</p><p class=dh>Afida, who shares two children with Ronnie, shared a picture of him and his famous mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCOYUbp-q3/>performing on stage</a> and chose not to caption the image. Instead, she only shared a string of emojis, including angry faces and crying emojis.</p><p class=dh>The media personality also posted another throwback picture of Ronnie and his older brother, Craig, and stated the siblings are now <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCTSUNpU3l/>reunited in death</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Tina Is a Grandmother of Two</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The "What Up?" star and the California native had two children together, making <a class="me a" href=#>Tina</a> a grandmother of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/tina-turner-grandchildren>two grandkids</a>. In May 2000, Tina's longtime makeup artist, Kevyn Aucoin, said the Grammy Award winner was still in shape and looked good regardless of how many kids or grandkids she had.</p><p class=dh>He revealed the American-Swiss native was busy trying to get everyone in shape but did not have a fitness routine herself because she had <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.people.com/archive/tina-turner-singer-vol-53-no-18/>never worked out</a>.</p><p class=dh>While not much has been reported about Tina's relationship with her grandchildren, she has been photographed with her sons on several occasions.
